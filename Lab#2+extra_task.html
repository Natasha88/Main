	<h2 id="bain">Bain à la Grenouillère, 1869</h2>
	<div class="p1"><p>La Grenouillère was a popular middle class boating and bathing resort of those times. Monet wrote on September 25, 1869, <span>“I do have a dream, a painting, the baths of La Grenouillère, for which I have made some bad sketches, but it is only a dream.”</span> The painting below and one in the London National Gallery are probably one of the sketches with the original tableau having been lost. Renoir, who was very close to Monet at the time, also wanted to do this painting.</p>

	<h2 id="parasol">Woman with a Parasol, 1875</h2>
  <p>One of his earlier works, this painting depicts his first wife Camille Doncieux with their elder son Jean. Camille is holding a parasol or a light umbrella and it seems that she is catching a glimpse of someone looking at her. The painting is early evidence of Monet focusing more on light and color as opposed to line and shape.</p>

	<h2 id="portrait">Self-Portrait with a Beret, 1886</h2>
	<p>Self-Portrait in Beret by Claude Monet, painted in 1886, is an example of a portrait painting which demonstrates the technique of oil on canvas, 56 x 46 cm. The portrait painting, ranked 2nd most prestigious genre by the French Académie de peinture et de sculpture, depicts the visual appearance of a human subject. While portraitists often strive for exact likeness, the viewer's recognition of the subject is of primary importance. It was common for artists to alter the image to accentuate or minimize the subject's physical, psychological or social traits. Traditionally, portrait paintings have memorialized the rich and powerful. Overtime, however, it became more common for middle-class individuals to commision portraits of their families and colleagues.</p>

	<h2 id="bridge">Bridge Over a Pond of Water Lilies, 1899</h2>
	<p>The painting is one of many executed by Monet with a horticultural theme. In this painting, the artist depicts an arched wooden bridge spanning a pond. There are several large clumps of colorful water lilies on the surface of the pond. The pond is surrounded by lush green vegetation. A clear blue sky can be partially seen through the trees, and also reflected in the pond’s water. The tall grasses, reeds and other vegetation are also reflected..</p>

	<h2 id="lilly">"Nymphéas" series, 1889-1926</h2>
	<p> “Nympheas” (or Water Lilies) have been described as “The Sixtine Chapel of Impressionism”. The series consists of approximately 250 oil paintings which were painted by Monet during the last thirty years of his life. Monet’s eyesight was badly deteriorating due to cataract while he painted most of these masterpieces. </p>
